    "  In the above reference, two datasets were created, using red and white wine samples.\n",
    "  The inputs include objective tests (e.g. PH values) and the output is based on sensory data\n",
    "  (median of at least 3 evaluations made by wine experts). Each expert graded the wine quality \n",
    "  between 0 (very bad) and 10 (very excellent). Several data mining methods were applied to model\n",
    "  these datasets under a regression approach. The support vector machine model achieved the\n",
    "  best results. Several metrics were computed: MAD, confusion matrix for a fixed error tolerance (T),\n",
    "  etc. Also, we plot the relative importances of the input variables (as measured by a sensitivity\n",
    "  analysis procedure).\n",
    " \n",
    "4. Relevant Information:\n",
    "\n",
    "   The two datasets are related to red and white variants of the Portuguese \"Vinho Verde\" wine.\n",
    "   For more details, consult: http://www.vinhoverde.pt/en/ or the reference [Cortez et al., 2009].\n",
    "   Due to privacy and logistic issues, only physicochemical (inputs) and sensory (the output) variables \n",
    "   are available (e.g. there is no data about grape types, wine brand, wine selling price, etc.).\n",
    "\n",
    "   These datasets can be viewed as classification or regression tasks.\n",
    "   The classes are ordered and not balanced (e.g. there are munch more normal wines than\n",
    "   excellent or poor ones). Outlier detection algorithms could be used to detect the few excellent\n",
    "   or poor wines. Also, we are not sure if all input variables are relevant. So\n",
    "   it could be interesting to test feature selection methods. \n",

    "  \n",
    "   Note: several of the attributes may be correlated, thus it makes sense to apply some sort of\n",
